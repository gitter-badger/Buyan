# background
project started after comments censored my tweet regarding Nazi( Stepinac) that is celebrated as a saint by latin heretic cartel in which I reflected on reports of his hands being red from orthodox blood that he litterally killed with a knife with his own two hands. Blog post introducing Buyan http://blog.nikola.link/#buyan       

now on freenode also #buyan      

this repo speciffically will be try to make an app from another angle and is meant to maybe merge with other repo later on    
hopefuly pouchdb backed blockchain mining in browser over webrtc should seal the deal with this repo

btw. workflow for this is     
`lein cljsbuild auto app` from app directory
and `gulp watch` from parent dir with chrome devtools(workspaces, source maps)
