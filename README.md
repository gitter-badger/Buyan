# CensorshipFreeCommentingPlatform
# background
project started after comments censored my tweet regarding Nazi( Stepinac) that is celebrated as a saint by latin heretic cartel in which I reflected on reports of his hands being red from orthodox blood that he litterally killed with a knife with his own two hands      

To start your new Phoenix application:
# setup for development
1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.start` (this should live reload backend)    
3. cd priv/static     
4. npm install && bower install      
5. run setup.sh like `. setup.sh`    
6. gulp build (initial build )
7. gulp watch (this enables livereload if developing from devtools for example)
then  devtools could be used for frontend

to start mongoseim server      
sudo docker run -it s2 bash     
mongooseimctl live     
when developing fronted run gulp serve from priv/static
when doing backend mix phoenix.server from top level would also be nice
