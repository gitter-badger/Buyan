# background
project started after comments censored my tweet regarding Nazi( Stepinac) that is celebrated as a saint by latin heretic cartel in which I reflected on reports of his hands being red from orthodox blood that he litterally killed with a knife with his own two hands. Blog post introducing Buyan http://blog.nikola.link/#buyan       
recently twitter can be perceived as a truth unfriendly place they censored me 3 times as far as I noticed     
because of tweets regarding latin heresy and various acts by nation stats coming from jesuit(devil's->since jesuits are godless heretics) doctrine of various fantasies justifying criminal activity     
since jesuits and entire latin heretic cartel were/are criminals and they felt need possibly to word their behaviour in evil tricky way in order to shove it down people's throats         
you can not have sex to be a virgin :-DD       
but some people find it an attractive idea if jesuits tell them it can be done         
now on freenode also #buyan      

this repo speciffically will be try to make an app from another angle and is meant to maybe merge with other repo later on    
hopefuly pouchdb backed blockchain mining in browser over webrtc should seal the deal with this repo

btw. workflow for this is     
`lein cljsbuild auto app` from app directory     
this will run docker     
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 peerjs  peerjs --port 8000 --key peerjs    
and `gulp watch` from parent dir with chrome devtools(workspaces, source maps)     
also intelij cursive clojure for editing(on save lein compiles gulp watch delivers to browser and devtools 
are being window on top intelij so it is instant debugging output
with js console and clojurescript repl devtools extension
)      
doc that will be up to date from time to time are here
